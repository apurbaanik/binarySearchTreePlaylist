Lab #5 - Creating a Spotify music playlist using binary search tree data structure.

This java program uses binary search tree data structure to make a sorted playlist on song title name and prints out an organized song data of full playlist and subset playlists of songs including average information.

This repository contains multiple CSV files of full weeks containing Top 200 Artist dataset downloaded from Spotify, the source code - binarySearchTreePlaylist.java, and two output file - "fullPlaylist.txt" - that contains all the songs in the binary search tree playlist in ascending order, and the other one - "subsetPlaylist.txt" - that will contain the output demo of subset method that takes the song titles of start and end and will print out the songs with average information that fall alphabetically between the start and end.

To store the songs in a binary search tree, I used the song title as the key for sorting comparisons and the song object as the value that contains the artist, the average number of plays for that song, and the average number of plays for the artist, across 4 weeks (1 month) in my analysis. This binary search tree doesn't contain any duplicates, and if there are any duplicates, it takes the total number of streams for that song to give the average information. It has a subset method that takes the song name of start and end, looks up the node of start, and starts printing all the nodes that fall between the end node. I have a song class that will have all the properties of the song including average information, a songNode class that has key and value, and left and right child, and the song playlist class which is my binary search tree class that has the root node, and has methods - addNode(), inOrderTraverse(), find(), & subset(). I also have the data extract method to read the CSV files of 4 weeks/ 1 month and for the output, it gives an average of 4 weeks for the songs.
